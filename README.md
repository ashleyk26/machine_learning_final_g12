## Code running directions

### Ashley
Ashley_inflation_prediction.ipynb - This file is my first file that includes the code I ran before I realized the flaw in my data, which was that the inflation dataset is not the actual inflation rate, it is the CPI value which is exactly like the CPI dataset that I was inputting. This led to incorrect results, and I had to change course and completely start over.<br> 
Ashley_analysis.ipynb - this is my final file and it contains all my correct code that utilizes the data correctly. It includes all relevant graphs and visuals.<br>
To run these code files:<br>
	(*) - connect it to your own google drive, and change paths to your machine
	(*) - run the code. If you run it inside the folder it was found in, all the data paths should work fine. You can just run it all at once, one cell after another, and you will get the correct results.
